# P2Secure

#### UPDATE: We won the prize for best use of BlockChain in our hack! YAY!

P2Secure allows users to lend their items and borrow items from others locally. Lenders will get an incentive to lend (get a rental fee from the borrower) and the borrower will be able to get items when they need it instead of having to pay a one-time large cost for purchasing the item. This is a great advantage for the borrower as they would be able to borrow a variety of items from tools and ladders to textbooks and bikes.

## Secure

People who lend will recieve a collateral in exchange for the item they are lending. P2Secure acts as an intermediary which secures the borrowing and ensures credibility.

We created this program to ensure that the lenders are credible and do not want to "scam" borrowers and also protecting the lenders if the borrower damages the item. 

## Local

The lenders and borrowers exchange items and contact info locally. The web app will show what items are available for borrowing. 

## Guaranteed Returns

Since the lender will hold a collateral, the borrower already has an incentive to return the item. The borrower would obviously want his deposit back. In addition, we use a ratings system to make sure only the fair lenders and borrowers are able to use the webapp.
